Pushing data to Pulse Send data about the key events in your software delivery workflow to feed the Pulse dashboards in real time. Sharing access with teammates Invite your teammates to your Pulse organization to share the access to the dashboards and metrics. 1. Creating your organization on Pulse \u00b6 You must create an organization on Pulse to start the onboarding. Click the link in the welcome banner at the top of the page and follow the instructions. To add more organizations, click the name of the current organization on the top left-hand corner and select Create Organization . 2. Pushing data to Pulse \u00b6 Pulse provides push-based integrations with your workflow using the following alternatives: One-click integrations Pulse currently supports the following \"one-click\" integrations that simplify the process of setting up your workflows to send data to Pulse: GitHub integration : reports changes and deployments PagerDuty integration : reports incidents Jira integration : reports lead and cycle time Note We recommend that whenever possible you use the integrations that match your stack because they're faster to set up. We plan to continue developing integrations for the most popular Git providers, CI/CD platforms, and incident management tools. Pulse CLI The Pulse CLI is a binary that you can use to push data to Pulse directly from your CI/CD workflows. Pulse Ingestion API Use the Pulse Ingestion API in scenarios where it may not be feasible to use the CLI to send data to Pulse, such as when you have the data inside an application. 3. Sharing access with teammates \u00b6 Share the Pulse dashboards with your teammates to bring more visibility to the metrics. The most convenient way of ensuring that all the members of your company have access to the Pulse dashboards is by enabling the feature Joining via email domain on the Organization page. When this option is enabled, anyone who signs up to Pulse using an email address from your company is automatically added to your Pulse organization. Alternatively, copy the invitation link from the Organization page and share the link with specific people. A convenient way to do this is to share and pin the link on your team's chat. The link is valid for 3 months, but you can refresh it at any moment. Newcomers will have access to all dashboards immediately after signing up without needing to perform any integration. About joining via email domain Consider the following when using joining via email domain : Joining via email domain isn't available for free email addresses. Each email domain can only be used in one Pulse organization. If an existing organization is already using your email domain to automatically join new users, you won't be able to activate this feature on another organization. You can only enable joining via the email domain that you used to sign in to Pulse. If you turn off the feature, you can only re-enable it using your email domain. Turning off joining via email domain doesn't remove users from the organization. If you turn off the feature, the users that joined while the feature was active will continue to have access to the organization on Pulse.

Sharing access with teammates"},{"location":"cli/cli/","text":"Using the Pulse CLI \u00b6 To measure the performance of your team you must send information to Pulse about changes, deployments, and incidents whenever they happen in the software delivery workflow of your primary application or service. To push information about these key events to Pulse using the CLI you must complete these main steps: Installing the Pulse CLI Download and set up the latest version of the Pulse CLI binary. Pushing changes and deployments Push information about changes and deployments when they happen on your software delivery workflow. Pushing incidents Push information about incidents when they're solved. Before you begin \u00b6 Consider the following before setting up the integration using the Pulse CLI: Make sure that you have an API key provided by Pulse to identify your organization and authorize you to send data to Pulse. When reporting events to Pulse you should use the field system to associate each event with the most granular unit that you will use to filter data on the Pulse dashboards, such as by application or service, product, or any other entity or group of entities in your organization. Important Typically, the value of system should be the name of the CVS repository corresponding to the event. However, if you're using a monorepo the value of system should be the name of the component in the repository instead. Although the field system is optional, if you don't report this information you won't be able to filter the data on the Pulse dashboards. Events without a specified system will be grouped under a special system called _unknown_ . When reporting deployments to Pulse you should use the field teams to associate each deployment with the list of teams that contributed with changes included in the deployment. 1. Installing the Pulse CLI \u00b6 Download the latest version of the Pulse CLI for your operating system and make sure that you're able to run the binary. Tip If you're using GitHub but our one-click integration doesn't fit your requirements we recommend that you use our Pulse GitHub Action as a convenient way to report events directly from your GitHub Actions workflows. The Pulse GitHub Action acts as a wrapper for the Pulse CLI and accepts the same fields as the Pulse CLI. Run the command to download the correct binary for your operating system: Linux macOS Windows On 32-bit operating systems: curl -fsSL -o pulse-event-cli https://artifacts.codacy.com/codacy/pulse/event-cli/latest/pulse-event-cli_linux_386/pulse-event-cli && \\ chmod +x pulse-event-cli On 64-bit operating systems: curl -fsSL -o pulse-event-cli https://artifacts.codacy.com/codacy/pulse/event-cli/latest/pulse-event-cli_linux_amd64/pulse-event-cli && \\ chmod +x pulse-event-cli curl -fsSL -o pulse-event-cli https://artifacts.codacy.com/codacy/pulse/event-cli/latest/pulse-event-cli_darwin_amd64/pulse-event-cli && \\ chmod +x pulse-event-cli On 32-bit operating systems: curl -fsSL -o pulse-event-cli.exe https://artifacts.codacy.com/codacy/pulse/event-cli/latest/pulse-event-cli_windows_386/pulse-event-cli.exe On 64-bit operating systems: curl -fsSL -o pulse-event-cli.exe https://artifacts.codacy.com/codacy/pulse/event-cli/latest/pulse-event-cli_windows_amd64/pulse-event-cli.exe Test if you can run the CLI: Linux and macOS Windows ./pulse-event-cli help pulse-event-cli.exe help If you need a specific Pulse CLI use the commands above but replace latest with the version you want. 2. Pushing changes and deployments \u00b6 Report an event to Pulse whenever your team deploys code to production, including the list of code changes included in that deployment: For SaaS applications, report the event on each deployment to your production environment. For self-hosted applications, a better option is to report the event each time you make an artifact available to any user of your application, such as when you release new binaries or upload a new version to an app store. Pulse uses these reports to calculate the metrics Lead time for changes and Deployment frequency . Using Git \u00b6 If you're using Git, send the following information when reporting changes and deployments to Pulse: Field Description Format previous-deployment-ref Git reference of the previous deployment. This can be a tag or a commit identifier. String identifier Version number or another unique identifier of the deployment. String timestamp Time when the deployment finished. Number (Unix epoch timestamp in seconds) system Optional. Repository or component to assign to this event. String teams Optional. Teams responsible for the changes in the deployment. String (comma-separated list) Run the following command to report a deployment and its changes: Linux and macOS Windows git clone <Git repository URL> cd < local Git repository directory> ./pulse-event-cli push git deployment \\ --api-key \"<API key>\" \\ --previous-deployment-ref \"<previous deployment ref>\" \\ --identifier \"<deployment identifier>\" \\ --timestamp \" $( date +%s ) \" \\ [ --system \"<system>\" ] \\ [ --teams <comma-separated list of teams> ] git clone <Git repository URL> cd < local Git repository directory> event-cli.exe push git deployment \\ --api-key \"<API key>\" \\ --previous-deployment-ref \"<previous deployment ref>\" \\ --identifier \"<deployment identifier>\" \\ --timestamp \"<timestamp>\" \\ [ --system \"<system>\" ] \\ [ --teams <comma-separated list of teams> ] The command automatically reports all commits done between the previous deployment and the HEAD of the Git repository as changes that belong to the deployment being reported. Without using Git \u00b6 If you don't use Git or prefer to have more fine-grained control over the information that you send when reporting changes and deployments, send separate reports for each change and deployment as described below. Tip If you're using Git, it's simpler to report changes and deployments together. Send the following information when reporting changes to Pulse: Field Description Format identifier The commit identifier. String timestamp Time when the commit was first pushed to the repository. Number (Unix epoch timestamp in seconds) system Optional. Repository or component to assign to this event. String Run the following command to report each change: Linux and macOS Windows ./pulse-event-cli push change \\ --api-key \"<API key>\" \\ --identifier \"<change identifier>\" \\ --timestamp \" $( date +%s ) \" \\ [ --system \"<system>\" ] event-cli.exe push change \\ --api-key \"<API key>\" \\ --identifier \"<change identifier>\" \\ --timestamp \"<timestamp>\" \\ [ --system \"<system>\" ] Send the following information when reporting deployments to Pulse: Field Description Format identifier Version number or another unique identifier of the deployment. String timestamp Time when the deployment finished. Number (Unix epoch timestamp in seconds) system Optional. Repository or component to assign to this event. String teams Optional. Teams responsible for the changes in the deployment. String (comma-separated list) Commit identifiers included in the deployment. String (space-separated list) Run the following command to report each deployment: Linux and macOS Windows ./pulse-event-cli push deployment \\ --api-key \"<API key>\" \\ --identifier \"<deployment identifier>\" \\ --timestamp \" $( date +%s ) \" \\ [ --system \"<system>\" ] \\ [ --teams <comma-separated list of teams> ] \\ <space-separated list of commit identifiers> event-cli.exe push deployment \\ --api-key \"<API key>\" \\ --identifier \"<deployment identifier>\" \\ --timestamp \"<timestamp>\" \\ [ --system \"<system>\" ] \\ [ --teams <comma-separated list of teams> ] \\ <space-separated list of commit identifiers> 3. Pushing incidents \u00b6 Report an event to Pulse whenever an incident resulting from a release or infrastructure configuration change to production is solved. Incidents are any form of degraded service that require remediation: The incident is created when you detect a service impairment or service outage in production. The incident is resolved when you apply a hotfix or patch, or when you rollback the changes to restore the service in production. Typically, it's possible to keep track of this information using your monitoring infrastructure or your ticketing system. Pulse uses these reports to calculate the metrics Time to recover and Change failure rate . Send the following information when reporting incidents to Pulse: Field Description Format identifier A unique identifier of the incident. String timestampCreated Time when the incident started or was detected. Number (Unix epoch timestamp in seconds) timestampResolved Time when the incident was resolved. Number (Unix epoch timestamp in seconds) system Optional. Repository or component to assign to this event. String Run the following command to report each incident: Linux and macOS Windows ./pulse-event-cli push incident \\ --api-key \"<API key>\" \\ --identifier \"<incident identifier>\" \\ --timestampCreated \"<timestampCreated>\" \\ --timestampResolved \" $( date +%s ) \" \\ [ --system \"<system>\" ] pulse-event-cli.exe push incident \\ --api-key \"<API key>\" \\ --identifier \"<incident identifier>\" \\ --timestampCreated \"<timestampCreated>\" \\ --timestampResolved \"<timestampResolved>\" \\ [ --system \"<system>\" ] See also \u00b6 Accelerate metrics Changes and reviews metrics","title":"Using the Pulse CLI"},{"location":"cli/cli/#using-the-pulse-cli","text":"To measure the performance of your team you must send information to Pulse about changes, deployments, and incidents whenever they happen in the software delivery workflow of your primary application or service.

Click Install GitHub App and follow the instructions on the GitHub UI to install the app on your organization. Important You can only install the Pulse GitHub App on an organization and not on your personal account. Wait until you get a confirmation that Pulse successfully created the integration and the webhook on GitHub. If there was an error please contact support . Choose the strategy to detect deployments that best fits your workflows, or turn off the automatic deployment detection. See the section below for a detailed description of each option. Automatic deployment detection strategies \u00b6 The following is a detailed description of how the Pulse GitHub integration automatically detects deployment using each detection strategy: Use merged pull requests (default) \u00b6 Pulse considers a deployment every merged pull request that targets the default branch of the repository. The deployment date is the timestamp when the corresponding pull request is merged. The set of changes in a deployment is the list of commits in the corresponding pull request. Pulse correctly tracks your changes even if you squash or rebase the commits when merging the pull request , since Pulse processes all the original commits before any changes to the Git history. Pulse associates all GitHub teams of the author of a merged pull request with the corresponding deployment, excluding teams with less than two members. Pulse only takes changes to GitHub teams into account on pull requests merged after those changes. Use semantic versioning tags \u00b6 Pulse considers a deployment every Git tag that follows the SemVer convention, excluding pre-release versions but allowing release prefixes. For example, the following are valid tags: 1.0.0 , v2.3.4 . To use this strategy, make sure that you're creating Git tags on your repositories for each successful deployment to production, or whenever you make a new release available to any user of your application: git tag -a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH -m \"<Deployment or release message>\" Where MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH must be a valid SemVer version without pre-release information. Check if your versioning syntax is valid . The deployment date is either the creation date of annotated tags or the timestamp when Pulse receives the webhook calls for lightweight tags . Keep in mind that since webhook calls can be delayed, the deployment date on Pulse could be imprecise and impact the metric Lead time for changes . The set of changes that belong to a deployment is the list of commits between the tag of that deployment and the previous tag. Because of this, Pulse discards: The first SemVer tag in the repository since there is no previous tag to compare with. Any tag that does not have a common ancestor (commit) with its previous tag, since Pulse cannot obtain the changes between them. Pulse associates all GitHub teams of the person who creates a Git tag with the corresponding deployment, excluding teams with less than two members. Pulse only takes changes to GitHub teams into account on Git tags created after those changes. Don't detect deployments automatically \u00b6 If the automatic deployment detection is turned off, Pulse doesn't detect deployments using GitHub events and you must report deployments using the Pulse CLI or the API. This is useful if none of the automatic deployment detection strategies match your workflow and you must have control over the way Pulse tracks your deployments. Collected data \u00b6 The table below lists the data that the GitHub integration collects from your GitHub organization, together with: The mapping between the data collected from GitHub and the Pulse data model The metrics that Pulse calculates from the data to display on the dashboards Data collected from GitHub Mapping to Pulse data model Used in Pull request commits Changes: change_id : commit UUID time_created : commit author date 1 system : repository name Lead time for changes on the Accelerate Overview dashboard Pull requests, git tags, or none ( configurable ) Deployments: deploy_id : pull request ID system : repository name Deployment frequency and Change failure rate on the Accelerate Overview dashboard Pull requests - Changes & Reviews dashboard , Work in Progress dashboard Teams Deployments: teams : GitHub teams of the author of a deployment 2 Filters the Accelerate Overview dashboard , Changes & Reviews dashboard , and Work in Progress dashboard by the contributions made by the team 1 : Pulse uses the commit author's date since it is more accurate. The committer date can be changed (e.g.: rebases) and stop reflecting the real creation date of the change. 2 : Adding a new team or changing the composition of a team on GitHub only affects new data from that moment onwards and doesn't have an immediate impact on the dashboards.
