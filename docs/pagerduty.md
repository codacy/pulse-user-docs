# Integrating with PagerDuty

Pulse can integrate directly with PagerDuty to receive Webhooks that will be ingested as incidents.

<!-- TODO Provide instructions on how to set up the integration using the Pulse UI

## Setup

1. Inside your PagerDuty account navigate to `Services` > `Service Directory` > `Choose a service` > `Integrations Tab` > `Add or manage extensions` > `New Extension`
2. Fill out the inputs:

    - **Extension Type**: choose `Generic V2 Webhook`.

    - **Name**: can be anything, but `Pulse` is a good default.

    - **Details**: include the URL of Pulse's ingestion API including the API key and system to where you are sending the data:

        `https://ingestion.pulse.codacy.com/v1/ingestion/pagerduty?system=<MY-SYSTEM>&api_key=<API-KEY>` 

        PagerDuty already has a concept of a service which can be a good starting point for the system field in the Pulse URL.
