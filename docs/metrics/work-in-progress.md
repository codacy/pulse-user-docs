# Work in progress metrics

## Work in progress

To provide you with an high-level view of the current work in progress of your teams, Pulse groups pull requests that are currently open by the following phases:

-   **Open:** the pull request is open but the team hasn't interacted or reviewed it.
-   **In review:** the pull request received at least one review but it isn't approved yet. Reviews include approvals, change requests, and inline pull request comments, but don't include conversation comments.
-   **Approved:** the pull request received at least one approval.
