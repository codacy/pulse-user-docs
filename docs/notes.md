# Tracking the impact of changes

Some changes in your organization, either internal or external to the environment, can impact your software delivery process. For example, changes in the team structure or membership, teams adopting new working processes, or major events affecting the system stability, might have a positive or negative impact on your teams' performance.

Pulse enables you to track and correlate the impact that specific changes might have on your teams' performance using **notes** to signalize actions or events that took place on a specific date.

Pulse shows your organization notes across the different dashboards - [Accelerate overview](metrics/accelerate.md), [Changes & Reviews](metrics/accelerate-changes.md), and [Lead & Cycle time](metrics/lead-cycle-time.md). This way you can compare each performance metric before and after a specific change occurred.

!!! note
    -   Notes are global to the organization. Any member can add or delete any note.
    -   Pulse dashboards show the data for the maximum one year period, thus you won't be able to see notes older than that period.

## Using notes

Pulse dashboards show a vertical line when there are notes for that period of time. Hovering each line, you'll see the notes icon below, near the dates axis. Click the notes icon to open the notes card and see all the notes for that period.

On the notes card, you can add new notes for the same period and delete existing notes.
