# Tracking the impact of changes

Some changes in the internal or external environment of your organization can impact your software delivery process. For example, changes in the team structure or membership, teams adopting new working processes, or major events affecting the system stability, might have a positive or negative impact on your teams' performance.

Pulse enables you to track and correlate the impact that specific changes might have on your teams' performance using **notes** to signalize actions or events that took place on a specific date.

Pulse shows your organization notes on all the dashboards - [Accelerate overview](metrics/accelerate.md), [Changes & Reviews](metrics/accelerate-changes.md), and [Lead & Cycle time](metrics/lead-cycle-time.md). This way you can compare the different performance metrics before and after a specific change occurred.
